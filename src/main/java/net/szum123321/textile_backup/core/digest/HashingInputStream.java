/**
 * This class calculates a hash of the file on the input stream, submits it to FileTreeHashBuilder.
 * In case the underlying stream hasn't been read completely in, puts it into BrokeFileHandler

 * Furthermore, ParallelZip works by putting all the file requests into a queue and then compressing them
 * with multiple threads. Thus, we have to make sure that all the files have been read before requesting the final value
 * That is what CountDownLatch does
