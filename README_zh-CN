 * killR - terminate current restoration.
 * list - lists all avaliable backups.
 * cleanup - forces cleanup procedure (deletes old backups according to config)
 * whitelist - here you can add, remove and list player that are allowed to run any operation within this mod despite not having high enough permission level*
 * whitelist - here you can add, remove and list player that are not allowed to run any operation within this mod despite having high enough permission level*
